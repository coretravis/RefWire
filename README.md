## Why RefWire?

Modern applications often rely on consistent and reliable **reference data**‚Äîdatasets like country codes, currencies, time zones, or product taxonomies that change infrequently but are used widely across systems. Traditional databases or bloated data services are often overkill for managing such static, read-heavy data.

**RefWire** was built specifically for this gap:

* üß† **Smart caching & indexing** ‚Äì For lightning-fast responses to common lookups and filtered queries.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Minimal configuration** ‚Äì Just point it at a JSON array, and you instantly get a full-featured API.
* üöÄ **Designed for performance** ‚Äì Built on .NET 9 Minimal APIs with efficient memory use.
* üîê **Secure out-of-the-box** ‚Äì With optional API key enforcement and per-client rate limiting.
* üîå **Pluggable architecture** ‚Äì Swap out storage backends (Azure, Local FS, etc.) or orchestration logic as needed.
* üß© **Easily embeddable** ‚Äì Use as a microservice in your stack or run it standalone for internal tooling.

### Ideal Use Cases:

* **Global reference data** (e.g., countries, currencies, languages)
* **Product catalogs and taxonomies**
* **Standard code lists** (e.g., ISO, UN, IATA)
* **Static metadata for frontend apps** (e.g., dropdowns, filters)
* **Read-heavy services in distributed systems**
* **Mock API generation from JSON samples**

If you‚Äôve ever found yourself serving static JSON files from an S3 bucket or maintaining a CRUD app just to handle lookup tables‚Äî**RefWire is for you.**

## Quickstart

Using DockerHub
   ```bash
   docker pull coretravis/refwire:latest
   docker run -d -p 7010:80 --name refwire coretravis/refwire:latest
   ```

   **Manage RefWire:**
   You can manage RefWire at `http://localhost:7010` via the RefWireCLI.

   ```bash
  npm install -g @coretravis/refwire
  
  refwire dataset list-ids
  ```
  This will prompt you for:
  - RefWire Url: Your RefWire Instance URL `http://localhost:7010`
  - ApiKey (Use 'ThisIsTheApiKey' for demo purposes but make sure to set a strong key for production via Configuration)
  - ListStor Server Url (optional): Set this to `https://refpack.refwire.online` to use the `refwire dataset pull {datasetID}` command which gives you access to standardized datasets         found at https://stor.refwire.online
  - **Note: You will only need to set the configuration only once**

  **Add your first dataset**
  ```bash
  refwire dataset pull currencies
  ```
  **Or Import your first dataset from a JSON array file**
  ```bash
  refwire dataset import
  ```
 

  **Explore RefWire APIs:**
  You can explore the RefWire APIs using the [RefWire Explor](https://refwire.online/explor) API Explorer, which provides an interactive interface to test endpoints and view responses.

## Architecture

### Pluggable Persistence

- **Unified Provider Interface:**  
  RefWire stores/retrieves datasets and API keys as JSON using a common interface. Built-in implementations include:
  - **Azure Blob Storage Provider:** For scalable, geo-replicated cloud storage.
  - **Local File System Provider:** Suitable for development, on-premise and depending on your requirements even production deployments.
  
- **Extensibility:**  
  Developers can integrate custom providers (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage and even OneDrive or Google Drive) by implementing the defined interface.

### Caching & Preloading

- **In-Memory Caching:**  
  Datasets are loaded on demand and cached with sliding expiration. Frequently accessed datasets can be preloaded at startup to reduce response times.
  
- **Efficient Indexing:**  
  Advanced indexing‚Äîsuch as suffix trees‚Äîsupports rapid text searches and fast lookups.

### Security & Rate Limiting

- **API Key Middleware:**  
  Endpoints are secured using API key validation. Admin endpoints compare against a configured key, while regular endpoints validate keys via a dedicated service.
  
- **Rate Limiting & CORS:**  
  Configurable limits based on client IP and custom CORS policies help protect the service from abuse.

### Distributed Orchestration

- **Leader/Follower Model:**  
  Multiple RefWire instances can coordinate, share state.
  
- **Pluggable Orchestration Provider:**  
  Managed via a provider interface for flexibility with custom orchestration backends. The default is an Azure Blob Storage provider.
  
- **CLI Integration:**  
  **RefWireCLI** provides commands to manage distributed instances (e.g., register, list, remove, elect leaders) directly from the command line.

---

## CLI Management ‚Äì RefWireCLI

## Usage

<details>
<summary><strong>API Endpoints</strong></summary>

RefWire exposes RESTful API endpoints for interacting with datasets and items, along with administrative functions. Endpoints are generally divided into:

1.  **Public Item Endpoints:** Primarily for reading dataset items. These are the most commonly used endpoints for applications consuming RefWire data.
2.  **Administrative Endpoints:** For managing datasets, items, API keys, backups, and system health. These typically require authentication (e.g., using the master `REFWIRE__APIKEY` or a specific admin API key) and are often prefixed with `/admin/`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Item Endpoints (Public Access)</strong></summary>

These endpoints allow querying items within a specific dataset. They offer powerful features like selective field inclusion (`includeFields`) and linking related data from other datasets (`links`).

*   **`GET /datasets/{id}/items/{skip}/{take}`**
    *   **Description:** Retrieves a paginated list of non-archived items from the specified dataset (`{id}`). Use `{skip}` for the starting index (0-based) and `{take}` for the maximum number of items per page.
    *   **Query Parameters:** Supports `includeFields` and `links` (see explanation below).

*   **`GET /datasets/{id}/items/{itemId}`**
    *   **Description:** Retrieves a single, non-archived item by its unique identifier (`{itemId}`) from the specified dataset (`{id}`).
    *   **Query Parameters:**
        *   Supports `includeFields` and `links` (see explanation below).    

*   **`POST /datasets/{id}/items/search-by-ids`**
    *   **Description:** Retrieves multiple non-archived items by their specific IDs from the specified dataset (`{id}`). Send a JSON array of item IDs in the request body (e.g., `["id1", "id2", "id3"]`).
    *   **Query Parameters:** Supports `includeFields` and `links` (see explanation below).

*   **`GET /datasets/{id}/items/{skip}/{take}/search`**
    *   **Description:** Performs a text search against the `NameField` of non-archived items within the specified dataset (`{id}`). Provides paginated results.
    *   **Query Parameters:**
        *   `searchTerm` (Required): The text string to search for.
        *   Supports `includeFields` and `links` (see explanation below).

**Understanding `includeFields` and `links` Query Parameters:**

These optional parameters, available on the `List`, `SearchByIds`, `GetById` and `Search` item endpoints, allow you to customize the data returned for each item:

*   **`includeFields`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Controls which specific fields from an item's `Data` object are included in the response. This helps reduce payload size when only certain details are needed.
    *   **Format:** A comma-separated string of field names (e.g., `?includeFields=capital,currency_code,population`).
    *   **Behavior:**
        *   **If provided:** Each returned item will include its standard `Id` and `Name`, and its `Data` object will contain *only* the fields specified in the `includeFields` list.
        *   **If omitted:** Items are returned with only their `Id` and `Name`. The `Data` object will be empty or minimal (it might still contain data added via the `links` parameter, if used). This provides a lightweight response when detailed data isn't needed.

*   **`links`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Fetches and embeds related data from *other* datasets into the current item's response, based on a defined relationship. This enables retrieving connected information (e.g., a country and its associated airports) in a single API call.
    *   **Format:** A comma-separated string specifying the relationship in the format `linkedDatasetId-foreignKeyField`.
        *   `linkedDatasetId`: The ID of the dataset you want to pull related data *from*.
        *   `foreignKeyField`: The name of the field *within the linked dataset* that contains the value matching the `Id` of the items in the *current* dataset being queried.
    *   **Example:** Querying a `countries` dataset (items have an `Id` like `USA`) and wanting to include related airports from an `airports` dataset (where airport items have a field `countryid_iso3` containing `USA`). Use:
        `?links=airports-countryid_iso3`
    *   **Behavior:** For each item returned from the primary dataset query (e.g., a specific country):
        1.  RefWire takes the primary item's `Id`.
        2.  It searches the specified `linkedDatasetId` (e.g., `airports`).
        3.  It finds all items within that linked dataset where the value of the `foreignKeyField` (e.g., `countryid_iso3`) matches the primary item's `Id`.
        4.  These found related items (e.g., all airports for `USA`) are then embedded within the primary item's `Data` object. The structure typically involves adding a key to the `Data` object named after the `linkedDatasetId` (e.g., `"airports"`) containing an array of the matching linked items.

</details>

*   `POST /admin/datasets/{id}/items/bulk`: Adds multiple new items to a dataset in a single request.
*   `PUT /admin/datasets/{id}/items/{itemId}`: Updates an existing item in a dataset.
*   `DELETE /admin/datasets/{id}/items/{itemId}`: Archives (soft-deletes) an item in a dataset.

**API Key Management** *(Only available if API Key Security is enabled)*:

*   `POST /admin/api-keys/`: Creates a new API key, returning the secret key value once.
*   `GET /admin/api-keys/`: Lists all API keys (excluding the secret key value).
*   `GET /admin/api-keys/{id}`: Retrieves details for a specific API key (excluding the secret key value).
*   `PUT /admin/api-keys/{id}`: Updates an existing API key (e.g., Name, Description, Scopes).
*   `DELETE /admin/api-keys/{id}`: Revokes (deletes) an API key.

**Backup Management:**

*   `GET /admin/backups/{datasetId}`: Lists available backup files for a specific dataset.
*   `POST /admin/backups/restore/{datasetId}`: Initiates restoring a dataset from a specified backup file.

**Health & Orchestration:**
